Current Issue
In telecom network operations, the Customer Information Questionnaire (CIQ) is the blueprint for site rollout and configuration in telecom network operations. However, the process of transforming CIQs into NE Grow/Cell Grow templates involves several challenges.


Our Proposal: We develop an AI Agent-based System designed to efficiently convert raw Customer Information Questionnaires (CIQs) into deployment-ready NE/Cell Grow templates, ensuring speed, accuracy, and explainability throughout the process. Additionally, the system enhances global operations support by enabling seamless multilingual communication and cross-regional collaboration.
Key Components of Hybrid AI stack: 
Data Cleaner Agent 
Standardizes raw CIQ formats into a Samsung Standard CIQ.
Normalizes naming, units, and missing fields using rule-based mappings + lookup retrieval.
Semantic Mapper Agent 
Uses domain-tuned embeddings to align CIQ fields to NE/Cell Grow template fields.                
Handles one-to-many and many-to-one mappings with semantic similarity search.
Validator Agent
Checks compliance against domain constraints (PCI uniqueness, EARFCN ranges, duplicate checks, etc.).
Suggests corrections where violations occur
Explainer Agent
Provides human-like explanations for every mapping decision.
Allows engineers to “chat with the CIQ” and ask why certain mappings were made.
Multilingual Operations Support Agent
Uses multilingual embeddings to translate CIQ-related content into target languages and vice versa, ensuring seamless cross-linguistic communication.
Handles complex mappings between languages with semantic similarity search for accurate and context-aware translations.
